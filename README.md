# metatrader5-cli

A pip-installable tool that gives AI agents and humans hands to MetaTrader 5.

## Status

- **Phase 2 complete** — `mt5_cli/` library shipped (bridge, market, rates,
  orders, positions, account, history, risk, config, reports, chart,
  screenshot). 240+ unit tests, bridge singleton enforced.
- **Phase 3a complete** (tag `phase-3a-complete` at `854f9dd`) — `mt5` CLI
  shipped with 11 command groups wrapping the library. Three Codex review
  cycles closed (11 findings resolved). 367 pytest passing.
  Verified end-to-end against live Trading.com demo (24/24 commands).
- **Phase 3 complete** (tag `phase-3-complete` at `78399d9`) — MQL5 plugin
  host shipped: compiler, deployer, discovery, and minimal scaffold templates
  for user EAs/indicators. 433 pytest passing.
- **Phase 4 reviewed GO** (HEAD `aaf08dc` on `mt5-universal`) — Strategy
  Tester driver shipped and reviewed: cache, ini/.set builder, launcher,
  HTML/journal/XML results parser, EA single/optimize/scanner/stress, indicator
  visual, and `mt5 tester ...` CLI. Full suite reached 499 pytest passing.
  Final tag is intentionally held until the live execution smoke is green:
  Trading.com demo is a live broker environment, `order dryrun` is green, but
  live trade placement currently returns broker retcode `10018 Market closed`.
  Screenshot-backed closeout showed MT5 does not apply tester `/config` to an
  already-running terminal, so `mt5 tester ea single` now returns
  `TERMINAL_ALREADY_RUNNING` in that state; full EA smoke still requires an
  operator-approved fresh-terminal run.
- **Phase 5 TODO** — `mt5-mcp` MCP server (FastMCP).
- **Phase 6 TODO** — full XDG/APPDATA path resolution + portability tests.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehukaimedia/Metatrader5-CLI.git
cd Metatrader5-CLI
pip install -e .
```

The `mt5` console script is registered automatically.

## Quickstart

Run with a Trading.com MT5 terminal already open and logged in:

```bash
mt5 --help                                  # list all 14 command groups
mt5 status                                  # account + connection summary
mt5 --json market info EURUSD               # symbol info (JSON for agents)
mt5 rates fetch USDJPY H1 --bars 10         # recent OHLCV bars
mt5 chart list                              # enumerate open charts
mt5 chart new EURUSD --timeframe M15        # File > New Chart > EURUSD
mt5 order dryrun EURUSD buy --volume 0.01 --sl 1.1600   # validate without placing
mt5 screenshot take                          # capture the active MT5 window
```

Every command supports `--json` for parseable envelopes. Exit code is
always 0; success/failure lives in the envelope's `ok` field.

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/metatrader5-cli.json` (override via `MT5_CONFIG`
env var). Trading.com is the current single-broker scope (FOK filling,
no hedging, 22:00 UTC rollover). Multi-broker support is a future task.

Live trading on REAL accounts requires all three: `cfg["live"]: true` +
`MT5_LIVE=1` env + `--live` CLI flag. DEMO and CONTEST accounts bypass the
REAL-account triple lock by design, but they are still live broker execution
environments. Treat demo testing with the same operational discipline: tiny
volume, explicit `--live` on mutation smoke tests, and clean-up checks for
open positions and pending orders.

## User workspace layout

`metatrader5-cli` is a tool — you install it once and run `mt5` from your
own project directory. Your MQL5 EAs, indicators, `.set` presets, and
tester results live in YOUR project, never in this repo:

```
my-trading-project/
├── ea/                       # your MQL5 Expert Advisors
│   ├── my_strategy.mq5
│   └── my_strategy.ex5       # built by `mt5 ea compile my_strategy`
├── indicators/               # your MQL5 indicators
│   └── my_signal.mq5
├── presets/                  # tester .set files (Phase 4)
├── results/                  # tester run snapshots (Phase 4)
└── .metatrader5-cli.json     # optional per-project config override
```

`mt5` discovers EAs/indicators in this order: `./ea` / `./indicators`
(CWD) → `~/.local/share/metatrader5-cli/{ea,indicators}/`
(XDG_DATA_HOME convention; `%APPDATA%/metatrader5-cli/` on Windows).
First match wins.

You can also keep your EAs and indicators centrally under
`~/.local/share/metatrader5-cli/` and run `mt5` from anywhere. The tool
ships only minimal MQL5 skeletons (`ea_minimal.mq5`,
`indicator_minimal.mq5`); the strategy / calculation logic is yours to
author. See [mt5_cli/skills/USER_WORKSPACE.md](mt5_cli/skills/USER_WORKSPACE.md)
for the full resolution chain.
